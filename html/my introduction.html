        <font face="Technical" size="5">My name is Akshay Tiwari,and I am currently a student of class 10.<br>Today 
            ,I would like to take a few minutes to tell you more about<br> who I am-not just the facts
            ,but also the things that make me who I truly am.</p>
            <p>Let me start with a little bit about my background.I live in Bhopura,Ghaziabad,<br>and I come from a small family that has always supported and encouraged me.<br>
            My family plays a big role in my life,teaching me values like honesty,discipline,<br>and the importance of
            education.They have always reminded me that success<br> doesn't come overnight--it is the result of consistent effort and continuous learning.</p>
       <p>I love playing outdoor games like Cricket and Football. Playing outside keeps me active,<br>fresh,and teaches me 
        important lessons like teamwork,patience,and never giving up.<br>Sports help me balance my studies and also
        reduce stress.
       </p>These are my achievements in outdoor activities.</p>

<p>Right now, I am focusing a lot on two things:one is improving my English,<br> and the second is preparing
    for my board exams.I know that speaking English<br> fluently is not easy for me, but I am practicing every day. I 
    read, listen,<br> and speak-even if I make mistakes, I try again. I believe that one day, I will be confident and 
    fluent.
</p>
<P> Also, the class 10 board exam are very important for allof us. I want<br> to score good marks and make my parents
    and teachers proud.<br> I know it will take hard work, but I'm ready to give my best.
</P>
<p>As Nelson Mandela once said,<br><b><u>"It always seems impossible until it is done."</u></b><br>Nelson Mandela was agreat leader 
from South Africa who faught against injustice<br> and spent 27 years in prison for fighting for freedom.</p>
<p>This quote inspires me everyday to keep going, even when things are difficult.</p>
